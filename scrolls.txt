There's no real world (or rather, analog) equivalent to this way of reading, unless of course you're reading an actual scroll. (oh a scroll, I like scrolls)

you have to keep your eyes fixed on a certain point on the moving page (or at least be peripherelly aware of where you left off) in order to determine where to conintue reading

for many of us this happens almost subconsiously

but compjuters exist to help us, so let's have them help us with this

Scrolling in Firefox for example is much less jarring than in Chrome, due to its implementation of smooth scrolling.

On a page dominated by text on a blank background, there’s nothing for your eyes to latch on to while scrolling. Having a sparse page is often a design choice, and adding superfluous content just to provide a background against which to scroll would be silly.
 
One solution could be to add a transient anchor for your eyes to latch on to while scrolling.

 
To understand what I mean
First scroll through this document
Then try this one.
