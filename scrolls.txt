There's no real world (or rather, analog) equivalent to this way of reading, unless of course you're reading an actual scroll. (oh a scroll, I like scrolls)

you have to keep your eyes fixed on a certain point on the moving page (or at least be peripherelly aware of where you left off) in order to determine where to conintue reading

for many of us this happens almost subconsiously, but many, especially inexperienced computer users, find it jarring and confusing. Luckily, computers exist to help us, so let's have them help with this.



Sometimes I'll select a line of text before scrolling to keep track of where I left off reading.

There are loads of ways to scroll: using the mousewheel, the trackpad, your finger, dragging the scrollbar, clicking the scrollbar arrows, pressing the arrow keys, or page up/down, clicking the mousewheel, and many more.

Scroll distance
Roll the wheel one notch to scroll, with the default being three lines at a time.

Scrolling in Firefox for example is much less jarring than in Chrome, due to its implementation of smooth scrolling.

On a page dominated by text on a blank background, there’s nothing for your eyes to latch on to while scrolling. Having a sparse page is often a design choice, and adding superfluous content just to provide a background against which to scroll would be silly.
 
One solution could be to add a transient anchor for your eyes to latch on to while scrolling.

 
To understand what I mean
First scroll through this document
Then try this one.
See a demo here. Try the toggle button to see if you think it helps, or makes any difference at all.

The problem with this is that a lot of people start scrolling before reading all the way to the bottom of the page
